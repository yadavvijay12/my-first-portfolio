						<p>
								Electronic Commerce is process of doing business
								through computer networks. A person sitting on his
								chair in front of a computer can access all the facilities 
								of the Internet to buy or sell the products.
								Unlike traditional commerce that is carried out 
								physically with effort of a person to go & get products,
								ecommerce has made it easier for human to reduce physical
								work and to save time.E-Commerce which was started 
								in early 1990’s has taken a great leap in the world 
								of computers, but the fact that has hindered the growth
								of e-commerce is security. Security is the challenge
								facing e-commerce today & there is still a lot 
								of advancement made in the field of security.

						<p>
								The consumer moves through the internet to the 
								merchant's web site. From there, he decides that
								he wants to purchase something, so he is moved to 
								the online transaction server, where all of the 
								information he gives is encrypted. Once he has placed 
								his order, the information moves through a private
								gateway to a Processing Network, where the issuing
								and acquiring banks complete or deny the transaction.
								This generally takes place in no more than 5-7seconds
